# Cat-and-Dog-Image-Classifier
Develop an image classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using data science techniques in Python.After assembling a labeled dataset comprising diverse cat and dog images, I meticulously preprocessed the data, ensuring uniformity in image sizes and pixel values normalization. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and TensorFlow, I trained the model to discern intricate features crucial for classification. Data augmentation techniques were employed to enhance model generalization. Evaluation on a distinct testing dataset showcased the model's accuracy. The iterative process of fine-tuning, experimentation with hyperparameters, and continuous improvement contributed to the model's effectiveness.
